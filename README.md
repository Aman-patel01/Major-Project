Automated Brain Tumor using Convolutional Neural  Networks of multi-label MRI scans
This GitHub repository presents an automated brain tumor detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and conducts a comprehensive comparison of different algorithms for improved accuracy on multi-label MRI scans. The project aims to enhance the detection of brain tumors in medical images, facilitating precise diagnosis and treatment planning.
The repository features a carefully curated dataset of multi-label MRI scans, including tumor and non-tumor cases, with accurate annotations by expert radiologists. A state-of-the-art CNN architecture, along with variants like ResNet, Inception, and DenseNet, is implemented and evaluated. Traditional machine learning approaches (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests) are also explored for algorithm comparison.
Training scripts, guidelines, and techniques like transfer learning and data augmentation are provided to train and fine-tune the CNN models for optimal performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC are utilized to assess algorithm performance and robustness. Tools for visualization and interpretability enable insights into the model's decision-making and tumor localization within the brain scans.
The project emphasizes reproducibility and offers documentation and code for seamless deployment of the chosen algorithm in real-world scenarios. Collaboration and contributions from researchers, medical professionals, and machine learning enthusiasts are encouraged to further enhance brain tumor detection algorithms.
Sharing this project on GitHub aims to foster knowledge exchange and collaboration, advancing the field of automated brain tumor detection. By improving diagnostic accuracy, the project ultimately contributes to more effective treatments and better patient outcomes.
